# Engineering Hydrology Feature Ideas

Based on the CIV E 321 coursework and hydrology principles ($P - R - G - E - T = \Delta S$), the following features transform raw data into practical engineering tools.

## 1. The "Smart Foundation" Drainage Calculator
**Goal:** Determine the drainage requirements for a specific building footprint to prevent flooding.

*   **How it works:** The user draws a building footprint on the map.
*   **Hydrology Logic:**
    *   Uses **IDF Curves** (Intensity-Duration-Frequency) to simulate specific storm events (e.g., "1-in-100 year storm").
    *   Calculates **Peak Discharge ($Q_p$)** generated by impervious surfaces (roof, driveway) using the Rational Method ($Q=CiA$) or similar.
*   **Output:** Recommends the specific size of storm pipes, gutters, or "dry wells" needed to handle the runoff volume.

## 2. Soil Infiltration & "Percolation" Map
**Goal:** Assess the soil's ability to absorb water, influencing foundation design and stormwater management.

*   **How it works:** Queries soil data at the specific GPS coordinate.
*   **Hydrology Logic:**
    *   Integrates **Green-Ampt** or **Horton Infiltration models**.
    *   Identifies soil texture (Sand vs. Clay) to predict "Saturation Excess" runoff risks.
*   **Output:** A "Build-ability Score" or "Infiltration Index."
    *   *High Infiltration:* Suitable for standard septic systems or basic drainage.
    *   *Low Infiltration:* Requires advanced solutions like "Thirsty Concrete" (pervious pavement) or extensive sub-drainage.

## 3. LID (Low Impact Development) Simulator
**Goal:** Help engineers design "Green" infrastructure to mitigate the impact of new construction.

*   **How it works:** Users can virtually "place" mitigation features like Rain Gardens, Bio-swales, or Green Roofs on the property.
*   **Hydrology Logic:**
    *   Recalculates the **Rainfall Excess** by adjusting the abstraction/storage terms in the water balance equation.
    *   Demonstrates the reduction in peak runoff ($Q_p$) and total runoff volume ($V$).
*   **Value:** Provides quantitative data to prove to city regulators that the design maintains "Pre-development" hydrology, potentially speeding up permit approvals.

## 4. Automated Watershed Delineation
**Goal:** Identify if a specific plot of land is at risk from upstream runoff.

*   **How it works:** The user selects a plot of land.
*   **Hydrology Logic:**
    *   Uses Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to calculate flow directions.
    *   Delineates the **Watershed Boundary** (Ridge Line) contributing to that specific point.
    *   Identifies flow accumulation paths.
*   **Value:** Determines if the house is located at a "confluence" or flow path where water from the surrounding watershed naturally collects, signaling a high flood risk.
