# CivicScale: Alberta's Engineering Intelligence 🏗️🌿

## 🏗️ The Vision
**CivicScale** is a comprehensive data-driven platform designed for the **HackED 2026** competition. Built by a team of University of Alberta engineers (Civil, Environmental, Mining, and Petroleum), this project aims to bridge the gap between raw municipal data and actionable engineering insights. 

Our goal is to prototype a tool that helps urban planners and engineers visualize the intersection of infrastructure development, environmental impact, and resource management in Edmonton and the broader Alberta region.

## 🚀 The Problem
Urban and industrial growth in Alberta often happens in silos. Civil infrastructure projects, environmental conservation efforts, and energy resource management are frequently tracked separately. This lack of integration leads to:
- Inefficient infrastructure maintenance.
- Overlooked environmental risks (e.g., urban heat islands, drainage issues).
- Delayed reclamation of industrial sites.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js / TypeScript (for a robust, type-safe UI)
- **Styling:** Vanilla CSS (Modern, responsive design)
- **Mapping:** Leaflet.js or Mapbox GL JS (Interactive geospatial visualization)
- **Data Visualization:** Chart.js or D3.js (For infrastructure trends)
- **Data Processing:** Python / Pandas (for cleaning Alberta Open Data)

## 📊 Data Sources
We leverage high-quality datasets from the **City of Edmonton Open Data Portal** and the **Government of Alberta**:
1. **Infrastructure:** Roadway maintenance, building permits, and municipal census.
2. **Environment:** Urban tree canopy map, air quality indices, and drainage topography.
3. **Energy/Mining:** Inactive well sites and land reclamation records (via Alberta Energy Regulator).

## 👷 Engineering Focus
As students of the **Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering**, we are applying core principles to this prototype:
- **Civil Engineering:** Asset management and urban resiliency.
- **Environmental Engineering:** Low-Impact Development (LID) and ecosystem services.
- **Mining/Petroleum:** Site lifecycle management and sustainable reclamation.

## 📖 How to Run (Development)
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repo-url]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
